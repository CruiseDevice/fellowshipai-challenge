# Flower Classification Project

## Dataset Overview
This project uses a dataset of flower images for classification. The dataset includes multiple categories of flowers, with varying numbers of images per category. Here's a sample of the categories included:

| Category         | Number of Images |
|------------------|------------------|
| Alpine sea holly | 43               |
| Buttercup        | 71               |
| Fire lily        | 40               |

##Project Description
This project aims to classify different types of flowers using machine learning techniques. I utilized a pre-trained ResNet50 model and fine-tuned it on flower dataset to achieve accurate classification results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- PIL

## Usage
1. Prepare the flower dataset in the required format (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/)
2. Adjust the data loading and preprocessing steps as needed
3. Run the training script to fine-tune the ResNet50 model
4. Evaluate the model's performance on a test set
5. Use the trained model for predictions on new flower images
